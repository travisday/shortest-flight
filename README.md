# Shortest Flight
An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithim using graph theory to find the shortest flight path between two given airports. 

## How it Works
I parse a .txt with all the airports the routes between them. I then load this information into my graph class. The user inputs two airports and Dijkstra's gives you the shortest path to your destination. It shows mileage at each stop and total mileage.
